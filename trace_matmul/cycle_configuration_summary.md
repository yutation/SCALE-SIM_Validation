# Cycle Configuration Analysis Summary

## Overview
This analysis examines how different matrix configurations (MxNxK) with the same scale sim cycle count perform in terms of execution duration.

## Key Findings

### **Cycle Distribution**
- **Total unique cycle values**: 10
- **Cycle values with multiple configurations**: 10
- **Total configurations analyzed**: 120

### **Most Common Cycle Values**
1. **383 cycles**: 16 configurations (all 2xMxN matrices)
2. **389 cycles**: 16 configurations (all 8xMxN matrices)
3. **413 cycles**: 16 configurations (all 32xMxN matrices)
4. **509 cycles**: 16 configurations (all 128xMxN matrices)
5. **893 cycles**: 16 configurations (all 512xMxN matrices)

### **Duration Variation Analysis**

| Cycle Value | Configs | Mean Duration | Std Dev | Range | CV (%) |
|-------------|---------|---------------|---------|-------|--------|
| 383 | 16 | 1.287 μs | 0.194 μs | 0.490 μs | 15.1% |
| 389 | 16 | 1.457 μs | 0.128 μs | 0.621 μs | 8.8% |
| 413 | 16 | 1.535 μs | 0.115 μs | 0.499 μs | 7.5% |
| 509 | 16 | 1.594 μs | 0.165 μs | 0.620 μs | 10.4% |
| 893 | 16 | 1.856 μs | 0.261 μs | 0.820 μs | 14.1% |

### **Patterns Observed**

1. **Matrix Dimension Impact**: 
   - For the same cycle count, larger matrix dimensions (M, N, K) generally result in longer execution times
   - The K dimension (inner dimension) has the most significant impact on performance

2. **Cycle Value Patterns**:
   - **383 cycles**: All configurations have M=2 (smallest M dimension)
   - **389 cycles**: All configurations have M=8
   - **413 cycles**: All configurations have M=32
   - **509 cycles**: All configurations have M=128
   - **893 cycles**: All configurations have M=512 (largest M dimension)

3. **Duration Variation**:
   - Lower cycle values (383-509) show moderate variation (CV: 7.5-15.1%)
   - Higher cycle values show more variation due to larger matrix dimensions
   - The most consistent performance is with 413 cycles (CV: 7.5%)

### **Interesting Observations**

1. **Best Performance within 383 cycles**: `matmul_2x2x32` (1.070 μs)
2. **Worst Performance within 383 cycles**: `matmul_2x128x128` (1.560 μs)
3. **Most Consistent**: 413 cycles group (CV: 7.5%)
4. **Least Consistent**: 383 cycles group (CV: 15.1%)

### **Configuration Examples**

**For 383 cycles (16 configurations):**
- Fastest: `2x2x32` → 1.070 μs
- Slowest: `2x128x128` → 1.560 μs
- Range: 0.490 μs (46% variation)

**For 893 cycles (16 configurations):**
- Fastest: `512x2x8` → 1.517 μs
- Slowest: `512x128x128` → 2.337 μs
- Range: 0.820 μs (54% variation)

## Interpretation

1. **SCALE-Sim Consistency**: The simulator shows good consistency for similar matrix dimensions, with reasonable variation based on actual computational requirements.

2. **Dimension Sensitivity**: The analysis reveals that matrix dimensions significantly impact performance even when the theoretical cycle count is the same.

3. **Performance Predictability**: Within each cycle group, there's a clear pattern where larger matrix dimensions result in longer execution times.

4. **Optimization Opportunities**: The variation within cycle groups suggests potential for optimization based on specific matrix dimension patterns.

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that while SCALE-Sim provides consistent cycle counts for similar matrix configurations, actual execution time varies significantly based on matrix dimensions. This suggests that the simulator captures the theoretical computational complexity well, but real performance depends on the specific matrix layout and memory access patterns. The variation within cycle groups provides insights into the relationship between theoretical complexity and actual performance characteristics.
